The Government's efforts to improve theassessment of disability will be aligned with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), byrevising criteria of eligibility for benefits/services. Within this programme component, the Government will establish and expandexisting rehabilitation services within the primary health-care system, as well as create community-based after-school care,development and respite services for children with disabilities and their families. Fostering cross-sectoral cooperation amongeducation, health, child protection and social protection services for children with disabilities will be a key strategy tostrengthen the exchange of information and referral mechanisms among outpatient health facilities, preschools and social services.The national inclusive education system will be strengthened by transforming special schools into teaching support centres,developing the capacity of teaching/administrative staff, revising special-education needs assessments based on the ICF-CY,changing funding mechanisms and improving quality of instruction. The programme will further work to ensure that positiveexperiences and lessons learned from inclusive school policies and programmes are reflected in preschools.", "pcr_id": "0260/A0/05/883", "b": 306000.0, "as_of": "07-31-17"}], "year": 2018}
