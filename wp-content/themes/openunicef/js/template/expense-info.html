    data-content="<p>UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.  UNICEFâ€™s Strategic Plan 2014-2017 is a road map for the realization of the rights of every child. The integrated results and resources framework of the Strategic Plan identifies how total resources available to UNICEF are and will be allocated to the envisaged development and humanitarian results for children. It focuses the work of UNICEF on seven Outcomes: Health; HIV&AIDS; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); Education; Nutrition; Child Protection; and Social Inclusion. The seven Outcomes are further disaggregated into 43 Programme Areas, encompassing the whole range of programmes implemented by Country Offices. </p>">
