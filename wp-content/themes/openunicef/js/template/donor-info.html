    data-content="<p>UNICEF Country Programmes are funded entirely by voluntary contributions.</p>
    <p>The basis for the integrated (Programme and Institutional) budgeting process is the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2014-2017), which contains a single results framework for UNICEF, comprising seven programme outcomes and three organizational effectiveness and efficiency results. </p>
    <p>Programme budgets are funded from Regular Resources (RR) and Other Resources (OR) and used for implementation of programme activities and achievement of programmatic results. Institutional budgets are funded from RR and cost recoveries from other resources and special accounts. They are for costs related to Development Effectiveness, UN Development Coordination, Management, and Special Purpose Activities as approved by the Executive Board.</p>
    <p>RR comes from voluntary contributions of public and private sector donors, net income from sales, and miscellaneous income. They are the foundation on which UNICEF builds programmes that transform the lives of children, with a focus on those who are most in need. They are not predestined to any specific programme or activity, and can consequently be shifted towards areas of growing priority or to fill gaps as required. </p>
    <p>OR comes from voluntary contributions of public and private sector donors. They are the second-most efficient and effective contributions to the organization. Thematic funding is allocated on a needs basis, and allows for longer-term planning and sustainability of programmes. A funding pool has been established for each of the Strategic Plan 2014-2017 outcome areas as well as for humanitarian action and gender.</p>">
